description: .asciiz "Welcome to Shrek's Adventure Time!
Shrek, Donkey and Boots are sent by Lord Farquaad to rescue Princess Fiona. It won't
be easy, she is locked away in the highest tower of a treacherous castle. Your task
is to help guide our friends on their journey to save the Princess."

directions: .asciiz "Directions:
You must select one of the characters as your team leader. There will be numerous
scenarios with different options/actions(labeled 1-4). You must select one of these
actions to execute, your selection will be graded with a Success, Mediocre or Failure
depending on the quality of your selection (The quality of your response also depends on the 
character/team-captain that you pick). To win the game, you must get through all of these 
situations and save the princess. 
Each failure results in a death, you have 3 lives in total, so 3 failures means 
you lose the game. Also, if you get 2 Mediocre grades IN A ROW, that leads to a
death as well. A success grade bears no penalty, you just move onto the next scenario.

Each of the characters have different strengths and weaknesses listed below."

characters: .asciiz "Shrek:
	Shrek is a mythical creature that is feared by the villagers. Some say his strength
	is that of 10 men. His methods are not always foolproof and he is not the sharpest 
	tool in the shed. His stature leaves his enemies quivering with fear, however you can
	hear or see him coming from a mile away.
	
Donkey:
	Donkey is, well... a donkey. His four legs allow him to outspeed many opponents as he 
	is the fastest member of our crew. He is also known for his charisma as he is able to 
	talk his way out of situations. However, Donkey is a coward, which leads him to avoid 
	most confrontations. His mouth is one of his strengths, but it is also his weakness, 
	as he never shuts up, so people can always hear him; his hooves don't help in this 
	category (stealth)

Boots:
	Boots is a skilled feline swordsman with a cunning to maneuver his way out of sticky 
	situations. His small stature allows him to go places others normally could not and 
	also allows him to sneak by most opponents. He is also a very seductive creature. His 
	size is also his weakness because he cannot take on larger foes. He is also still a 
	cat, so he is subject to cat-like behavior such as fear of water and attention to 
	miscellaneous objects."

scene1: .asciiz "Our three heroes were all playing Shrek's Adventure Time at Shrek's swamp.
				All of a sudden, they hear commotion outside. It is a variety of fairy tale 
				creatures that were kicked out of their homes by Lord Farquaad. What do you do? 
				1: Attempt to drive them away
				2: Give up and live with it
				3: Seek lord Farquad's counsel
				4: Negotiate with said creatures"
scene2:	.asciiz "While journeying through the forest, our heroes encounter Robin Hood and his
				Merry Men. Shrek has wanted posters all over the land, so Robin Hood, being 
				chivalrous gent that he is, is looking to kill Shrek. They then approach our
				heroes with weapons armed and ready. They tactically split the heroes and corner
				them. 
				What do you do?
				1: Reason with the Merry Men
				2: Try to fight them
				3: Attempt to flee
				4: Quiver in fear praying for the best"
scene3:	.asciiz "Our heroes decide to go to Lord Farquad's castle. At the sight of the castle
				Shrek cracks a joke, saying that Lord Farquaad is compensating for something. 
				When they enter the arena, they see knights jockeying for position to save the 
				beautiful Princess Fiona. When the crowd sees Shrek, they are taken aback; they gasp 
				in disbelief. Lord Farquaad sees a perfect opportunity and exclaims 'The one who kills 
				the Ogre, will be the knight that will journey to save our princess!' The knights charge 
				our heroes, what do you do?
				1: Attempt to unleash Randy Orton's signature wrestling move: the RKO
				2: Use the giant keg as a steam roller
				3: Attempt to court the knights 
				4: Eat one of Shrek's onions"
scene4:	.asciiz "Lord Farquaad now commands our squad to go save Princess Fiona. This is the only way
				to rid Shrek's swamp of fairy tale creatures. They set sail on their journey, but outside	
				of Lord Farquad's castle, an immense corn field stands in their path. The corn field seems
				to have had a path carved through it like a maze. There seems to be no way around it as the 
				field stretches both ways for miles. How will you overcome this predicament?
				1: Head straight through it hoping for the best
				2: Set the field on fire to easily get across
				3: Use your cunning to get across the maze
				4: Try and go around"
scene5:	.asciiz "Our squad has gotten past the corn field. Long after the corn field, our heroes are famished,
				they are dearly in need of food other than onions. They come across a questionably looking tavern.
				They go inside, and all of the patrons look deadly. They sit at a table, and a server comes over
				and asks our gang what they would like to eat. What shall you order?
				1: A stout of mead
				2: More onions
				3: Steak-frites
				4: Double Triple Bossy Deluxe on a raft, four by four, animal-style, extra shingles with a shimmy and 
				a squeeze, light axle grease, make it cry, burn it, and let it swim"
scene6: .asciiz "Now our motley crew has arrived at the castle. There is a long, narrow bridge standing over a pool of 
				MOLTEN HOT LAVA. Inside the lava, there are volcano sharks with heat-vision. There is no other way into 
				the castle. How shall you cross?
				1: Give up, jump into the lava
				2: Have no fear, cross the bridge
				3: Roll across the bridge
				4: Use the pieces of the bridge to construct an aircraft"
scene7:	.asciiz "Our heroes have crossed the bridge of terror. Now they are standing in a VAST hall, 
				there are multiple directions to go. On the right, there is a narrow passageway with 
				a DO NOT ENTER sign. On the left, there is an entrance to an theme park, dubbed 'George's
				adventureland'. Straight ahead, there is a group of knights that are seemingly under the
				the influence.
				1: The three heroes decide to split up and go in different directions
				2: Go right
				3: Go left
				4: Go straight ahead"
scene8: .asciiz "They are passed the hall, and are now in an armory. They are shining suits
				of armor on the left side of the armory guarded by a sleeping witch. On the 
				right, there is an exit to the next room. 
				1: Sneak by the witch and get the armor
				2: Beat up the witch to get the armor
				3: Go to the next room
				4: Incept her"
scene9: .asciiz "After the armory, they enter a massive chapel. They are surrounded by rows
				and rows of pews and religious imagery all around. Suddenly, a deafening, 
				ferocious roar rang out. The chapel began to shudder and the ancient ceiling
				began to collapse. Quickly, what do you do?
				1: Hide beneath a pew and pray
				2: Try and avoid the oncoming debris
				3: Try to run back to the armory
				4: Go full Hulk"
scene10: .asciiz "After surviving the cave in, a pile of rocks created a pathway to the next
				floor. The way out of the chapel is now blocked, so there was no other option,
				they must adventure to the next floor. After climbing the pile, they are 
				greeted by a legion of pygmies. They stare at our group, but have no initial
				actions towards them. What do you do?
				1: Pretend they are small footballs and punt them
				2: Attempt to speak in their tongue
				3: Walk by them, ignoring their presence 
				4: Assert dominance and stare back"
scene11: .asciiz "A putrid odor emitted from the next room. As the brave adventurers neared
				the entrance, the source of the smell became apparent. They see an R-rated scene
				of piles of bones and corpses. They try to get through the room as fast as possible,
				but the exit door is locked. Maybe one of these bodies has the key! What dp you do?
				1: Search each corpse for a key
				2: Use a necronomicon 
				3: Use any means to bash the door down
				4: Pick the lock"
scene12: .asciiz "After what seemed like hours of walking through the complex castle, the heroes
				were at their wits end. Tensions were high and they had no sense of direction. They
				then stumbled upon a Super Comforter Recliner Chair 3000. It was equipped with dual
				cup holders and massage capabilities. This was too good to be true. There was a strange
				strap that seemed to fasten the user's head to the headrest. But who cares, comfy chair.
				What do you do?
				1: Sit back, relax
				2: Use someone else as a test dummy
				3: Pass up on this once in a lifetime chance
				4: Inspect thoroughly before attempting to sit"
scene13: .asciiz "Looking outside the castle windows, the tower where Fiona is can be seen getting
				closer and closer. They are stopped by two fairies guarding two doors. One fairy explains
				that one of the fairies is evil and will always lie, while the other is good and will always
				tell the truth. One door leads to the passage where Fiona is, while the other leads to doom.
				You can ask one fairy one question of which door to pick, then they show you the door based on
				your answer. What do you ask?
				1: Pick one of them and ask which door is the right way
				2: Pick one of them and ask which door the other fairy would say is the right door
				3: Ask one of them what the airborne velocity is of a swallow
				4: Yolo"
scene14: .asciiz "The next room was not friendly looking in the slightest. It was filled with instruments
				for torture and cruel devices for coercion. Shrek steps on a suspicious tile and
				suddenly the three heroes are plunged into a trap floor. Once inside the new room, the walls
				begin to close in and water begins to rise. There is a lever on one side of the room that is
				too far away to get in time and a vent on the other side that is much closer. What is you plan of action?
				1: Book it to the vent
				2: Use a lasso to pull the lever
				3: Use the powers of the force to repel the walls back
				4: Become a merman"
scene15: .asciiz "Moving on to the next room, a massive pit lies between them and the next door and where they stand.
				A large chandelier is hanging over the pit and seems to be able to sway back and forth. What do you do?
				1: Risk it for the biscuit, cross using the chandelier
				2: Assume whatever is at the bottom of this pit won't kill you
				3: Call upon your skunk-wing brethren
				4: Charge up like Sonic and shoot across"
scene16: .asciiz "Now, the heroes find themselves in a very large room. There is a large throne centered in the middle
				of the room. As they approached the throne, heavy breathing was heard. Looking around for the source
				in the dark room, a massive black outline could be seen just behind the throne. A fire breathing dragon was
				slumbering right before them, with fire emanating out of its maw every breath. Donkey lets out a yelp and
				awakens the beast! What should you do?
				1: Prepare for combat!
				2: Foos Roh Dah
				3: FLEEEEEEE
				4: Meld into the shadows"
scene17: .asciiz "The dragon easily chases them down and is now upon them! It bears its reptilian claws and begins to take a deep breath. 
				There is no way our heroes can survive this if they don't act fast! What shall you do?
				1: Stand your ground and FIGHT!
				2: Charm the dragon
				3: Throw down in a rap battle
				4: Use your gastrointestinal powers"
scene18: .asciiz "The heroes managed to survive a fiery doom, and reached the base of the highest tower of the castle. Fiona was close!
				They climbed up the tower and entered a room with a luxurious bed, and Fiona asleep on it. The crew approached 
				her, and shook her awake. She awakens, bewildered at the sight of the gang. They try to convince the princess to leave,
				but she is hesitant on whether to trust her 'heroes'. How do you convince her to go?
				1: Take off your armor
				2: Take her against her will
				3: Explain Lord Farquaad's mission
				4: Leave, she ain't coming"
scene19: .asciiz "The end of the heroes' quest was finally within reach! All they had to do now, was simply make their way
				out of the castle. Everything was smooth sailing, until they reached the chandelier room. The dragon flew up
				out of the massive pit, enraged at the band of heroes. The dragon lashed out, nearly striking Donkey's butt.
				Deal with this dragon once and for all!
				1: Quiver in fear
				2: Attempt to overwhelm it with your superior numbers
				3: Use the claymore conveniently placed nearby
				4: Drop the chandelier"
scene20: .asciiz "After the dragon has been defeated, the entire castle couldn't handle the intensity of
				the heated conflict. The walls and ceiling began to fall apart, sending huge debris all over the
				place. The heroes had to find a quick way to escape from the castle, and begin their final stretch
				back to Lord Farquaad. The team manages to make it back to the exit bridge,
				but the dragon once again surprises them and is trailing right behind. 
				It takes one more deep breath. Time is running out, what should you do?
				1: Seduce the dragon
				2: Smite the dragon and cast it into the fire chasm from whence it came
				3: Usain Bolt it outta there
				4: Show off your mad hops and jump across"

GameOver: .asciiz "You ran out of lives! Game over."

PlayAgain: .asciiz "Play again? Y/N?"

Victory: .asciiz "You managed to complete the impossible! You guided our group of heroes
				through the castle, through many challenges, and overcame a fearsome dragon.
				With Fiona part of the group now, the group makes their way back to Lord
				Farquaad's castle, so Shrek can reclaim his swamp. The end."
